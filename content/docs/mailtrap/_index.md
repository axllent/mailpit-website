[Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/?ref=mailpit) offers a solution that complements Mailpit. While Mailpit runs locally or on its own server, our friendly companion Mailtrap is a modern email platform that combines both **cloud-based sandbox and production sending in one place**.

## A shared Sandbox for your team

**Email Sandbox** acts as a shared catch-all SMTP traffic environment for your staging and development servers. Instead of trapping emails on your local machine, you send them to a shared project sandbox that your team can access.

This workflow helps you:

-   **Team Collaboration**: Let your team members test emails without needing access to a developer's local environment.
-   **Projects and Multiple Sandboxes**: When your project becomes larger, create isolated inboxes (sandboxes) for different apps or environments, or organize email activity under separate projects.
-   **Access management**: Allows you to manage users lists and accesses in order to securely isolate contexts.
-   **Automate Testing**: Use the Sandbox API to integrate email testing directly into your CI/CD pipeline.
-   **Inspect and Debug**: Just like Mailpit, it allows you to view email headers, check HTML/CSS rendering, and see how your emails will look on different devices. It also includes a spam score analysis to help you identify potential deliverability issues before you go live.
-   **SDKs for popular languages**

## Transitioning to production sending

While Mailpit and Mailtrap's Sandbox are strictly for non-production testing, Mailtrap also provides a strong, production-ready **Email API and SMTP service** for when your application is ready to send live emails to users.

This provides a clear path from development to production within a single platform, giving you access to:

-   **Reliable Email Delivery**: Focus on deliverability with features designed to ensure your emails reach users' inboxes.
-   **In-depth Analytics**: Monitor your production email streams with detailed logs and analytics to track performance and troubleshoot any issues that arise.
-   **Simple Integration**: Integrate via a standard SMTP configuration or use official SDKs for popular languages to get up and running quickly.

If a cloud-based, collaborative workflow sounds like a good fit for your team, Mailtrap offers a free tier that's a great way to get started and explore these features.
