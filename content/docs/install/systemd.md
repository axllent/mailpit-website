Mailpit can be easily configured via systemd to automatically start when your computer starts. 
There are few points worth noting before you do:
1. It is advisable not to run the service as "root" for security purposes. For this example we will use a user and group called "mailpit", but this could be any existing user on your machine.
2. The database store must be read/writable by this user otherwise Mailpit will fail to start. For this example we use `/var/lib/mailpit/mailpit.db`


Create a systemd service configuration file in `/etc/systemd/system/mailpit.service`

```shell
[Unit]
Description=Mailpit server

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/mailpit -d /var/lib/mailpit/mailpit.db
Restart=always
# Restart service after 10 seconds service crashes
RestartSec=10
SyslogIdentifier=mailpit
User=mailpit
Group=mailpit

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Enable the service

```shell
systemctl enable mailpit.service
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/mailpit.service → /etc/systemd/system/mailpit.service.
```

## Start the service

```shell
systemctl start mailpit.service
```

## Verify Mailpit is running

```shell
systemctl status mailpit.service
