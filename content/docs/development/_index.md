Mailpit is completely open source under the MIT license, and we welcome contributions from developers. However, there are a few key points to keep in mind:

1. Not all pull requests will be accepted. New features should align with Mailpit's core purpose as a development SMTP and email testing tool.
2. Mailpit caters to a broad community, so if a feature request is too narrowly focused on individual needs and does not benefit the wider user base, it may not be approved.
3. Each new feature adds complexity to the codebase, requiring ongoing maintenance and support in the future. This consideration is crucial when evaluating the addition of new features.
4. The final decision on whether to accept or reject a pull request rests with the project maintainer. This decision is not personal.
