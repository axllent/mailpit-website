Mailpit provides a modern web UI to inspect captured messages, and can be accessed via your web browser on HTTP port 8025. Both the port number and enabling of [HTTPS](../configuration/http/) can be configured via the [runtime options](../configuration/runtime-options/).

Within the web UI, multiple messages can be selected while holding down the `Ctrl`/`Cmd` or `Shift` button and clicking on messages. The selected messages can then all be marked as read/unread or deleted.

Tag filtering (assuming you have tagged messages) can also be toggled to filter by more than one tag by holding down the `Ctrl`/`Cmd` button and clicking on the tags listed on the left.
