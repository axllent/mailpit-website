To conserve space, Mailpit keeps the latest 500 messages by default, silently deleting older messages at regular intervals. This limit is configurable in the [runtime options](../../configuration/runtime-options/), and can be disabled by setting `--max 0`.


There are various ways to manually delete messages:

1. Individual messages can be deleted by clicking the `Delete` button while previewing a message.
2. Select one or more messages by holding down `Ctrl`/`Cmd` or `Shift` and clicking on a the messages in the list. These can then be deleted via the `Delete selected` button, or alternatively marked as read/unread.
3. In the Inbox (main) view, the `Delete all` button will delete all messages (everything).
4. While filtering messages, either by a search or viewing a tag, clicking the `Delete all` button will delete all matching results.
