description: Ingest a message or folder of messages into Mailpit
---

Existing bulk messages can be ingested (imported) using `mailpit ingest <file|folder>`. By default, this will read the message(s) on disk and send them via SMTP to `localhost:1025`; however, you can specify a different host/port using the `--smtp-addr` flag.

{{< tip "warning" >}}
Ingested messages must be individual email files and not in mbox format (i.e., not all messages in one file).
{{< /tip >}}

This can be useful for transferring an entire mailbox of messages directly into Mailpit and can be combined with `--recent <x>` to only consider messages modified within the last `x` days. If you are regularly "syncing" a folder to Mailpit, then this, combined with Mailpit's `--ignore-duplicate-ids` flag, will prevent any duplicate messages from being added.
